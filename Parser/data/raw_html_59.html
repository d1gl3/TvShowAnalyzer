		<p>Scene: The lobby.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!</p>
<p>Sheldon: Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Penny: What?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I was going to get my mail.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.</p>
<p>Penny: God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, here’s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends.</p>
<p>Penny: Really?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I’d hate for that effort to have been in vain.</p>
<p>Penny: Right.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?</p>
<p>Penny: Everyone.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Harsh terms. But all right, I’ll just substitute intercourse.</p>
<p>Penny: Great.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve.</p>
<p>Penny: So, how you been?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, my existence is a continuum, so I’ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period.</p>
<p>Penny: You’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Bazinga.</p>
<p>Penny: Mmm. How’s Leonard doing?</p>
<p>Sheldon: He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.</p>
<p>Penny: I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.</p>
<p>Penny: Yep.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat.</p>
<p>Penny: Interesting. I’ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m hungry now.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh. Um, okay. Why don’t you give me an hour and come over?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?</p>
<p>Penny: I don’t have hot dogs.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).</p>
<p>Leonard: Hey, where you been?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I was talking with Penny.</p>
<p>Howard: What’s wrong with you? You can’t hang out with your roommate’s ex. That’s totally uncool.</p>
<p>Leonard: No, no, it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it.</p>
<p>Raj: Yeah, he’s over it, that’s why he’s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.</p>
<p>Howard: So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You’re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Which one picks last?</p>
<p>Howard: What?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, usually I’m on the team that picks last. Unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!</p>
<p>Leonard: Okay.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?</p>
<p>Leonard: I don’t know. Why?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!</p>
<p>Credits sequence</p>
<p>Scene: A few moments later.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, God, this is good.</p>
<p>Raj: Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you’re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?</p>
<p>Howard: Jews don’t have hell. We have acid reflux.</p>
<p>Leonard: Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!</p>
<p>Leonard: So, you guys want to do something tonight?</p>
<p>Howard: Nah, I can’t. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.</p>
<p>Leonard: What about you, Raj?</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.</p>
<p>Leonard: I never stopped hanging out with you.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, please, we all know I’m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I’d be Aquaman.</p>
<p>Howard: I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.</p>
<p>Leonard: You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.</p>
<p>Raj: What, suddenly I’m not good enough for you?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my after-dinner walk.</p>
<p>Leonard: Since when do you take after-dinner walks?</p>
<p>Howard: Yeah, since when do you take walks?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Howard: Hold on. I’ll walk down with you.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, that’s not necessary. You can go first.</p>
<p>Howard: Or we could go together.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I can’t think of a reason why not.</p>
<p>Howard: Let’s go.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Hold on. Nope, no reason.</p>
<p>Raj: I’ve missed you.</p>
<p>Scene: The lobby.</p>
<p>Sheldon: All right, say hello to your mother for me.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay.</p>
<p>Sheldon: What?</p>
<p>Howard: You said you were going for a walk.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I didn’t say outside.</p>
<p>Howard: So what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?</p>
<p>Sheldon: No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>Woman’s voice: Here Bubbles. Here boy.</p>
<p>Howard: Which way are you going?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Which way are you going?</p>
<p>Howard: I parked my scooter down the block.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m going the other way. Bye.</p>
<p>Howard: Bye. Actually, I’m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?</p>
<p>Sheldon: No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.</p>
<p>Howard: I definitely smell raw hot dog.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.</p>
<p>Howard: All right, have a nice walk.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I shall. Have a nice scoot.</p>
<p>Howard: You might want to stand back. I’m sitting on top of 13 horses here.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!</p>
<p>Scene: Penny’s apartment.</p>
<p>Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door. A dishevelled Sheldon is holding up one hot dog.) Here. I had to trade the others for my life.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment.</p>
<p>Raj: Hey, Leonard?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah?</p>
<p>Raj: I haven’t had s*x in a year.</p>
<p>Leonard: Where you going with this, Raj?</p>
<p>Raj: Don’t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.</p>
<p>Leonard: So, go.</p>
<p>Raj: Well, I need a wingman. I don’t want to come off like a lonely loser.</p>
<p>Leonard: And you think my presence will help with that?</p>
<p>Raj: Well, I do. Next to you, I’ll look like a catch.</p>
<p>Leonard: I’m not going out tonight, Raj.</p>
<p>Raj: All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?</p>
<p>Leonard: Very much.</p>
<p>Raj: Doesn’t have to be Asian.</p>
<p>Leonard: Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday.</p>
<p>Raj: No, I won’t.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.</p>
<p>Raj: You really think so?</p>
<p>Leonard: I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.</p>
<p>Raj: But we’ll have s*x first, right?</p>
<p>Scene: Penny’s apartment.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian.</p>
<p>Penny: So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.</p>
<p>Penny: Well, good.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.</p>
<p>Penny: He’s been crying?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn’t supposed to mention.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, God, I feel terrible.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Do you have a stomach ache, too?</p>
<p>Penny: No. Why, do you?</p>
<p>Sheldon: No.</p>
<p>Penny: Why did you ask if I had one, too?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.</p>
<p>Penny: All right. So, what’s new in your life?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, my new shoes are not made for running.</p>
<p>Penny: Have you been running?</p>
<p>Sheldon: No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.</p>
<p>Penny: I’m so glad you like it.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I do. Leonard never cooks for me.</p>
<p>Penny: Well, maybe that’s ’cause Leonard can’t cook.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You can’t cook and you made me this.</p>
<p>Penny: Whatever. Ooh, I’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, Lord, I’m in Jewish hell.</p>

<p>Scene: The apartment.</p>
<p>Raj: Look at this. Do you think she’s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?</p>
<p>Leonard: I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.</p>
<p>Raj: You don’t know that. Prison changes people.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hey, where you been?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I told you, walking.</p>
<p>Leonard: For an hour and a half?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I got lost.</p>
<p>Leonard: How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Satellites are down. Solar flares.</p>
<p>Raj: There are no solar flares right now.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yes, there are.</p>
<p>Raj: Dude, I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I’d be all up in it.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.</p>
<p>Leonard: What the hell was that about?</p>
<p>Raj: I don’t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, we really need to get you a girl.</p>
<p>Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Leonard is asleep.</p>
<p>Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, just come in!</p>
<p>Sheldon: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.</p>
<p>Leonard: What do you want, Sheldon?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Maybe this isn’t a good time.</p>
<p>Leonard: Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.</p>
<p>Leonard: What do you want?</p>
<p>Sheldon: You may want to sit down.</p>
<p>Leonard: I’m in bed!</p>
<p>Sheldon: Point taken. You may want to sit up.</p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon!</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back.</p>
<p>Leonard: Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?</p>
<p>Sheldon: We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?</p>
<p>Leonard: Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.</p>
<p>Leonard: Then why did you have Chinese food with us?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.</p>
<p>Leonard: Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.</p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon, I don’t care if you want to be friends with Penny.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yes.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.</p>
<p>Leonard: I guess not.</p>
<p>Sheldon: And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.</p>
<p>Scene: The laundry room.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, um, I, I can come back.</p>
<p>Leonard: D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, I guess you’re right.</p>
<p>Leonard: You used to it yet?</p>
<p>Penny: Nope.</p>
<p>Leonard: Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.</p>
<p>Leonard: His mother?</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.</p>
<p>Leonard: I was going to do that.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, well, then you, you do it.</p>
<p>Leonard: No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, you can take him for shoes.</p>
<p>Leonard: I just took him for shoes.</p>
<p>Penny: Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.</p>
<p>Leonard: Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.</p>
<p>Leonard: You’re taking him to Disneyland?</p>
<p>Penny: Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?</p>
<p>Leonard: All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.</p>
<p>Penny: We’re going to Disneyland. He’s going to eat junk food.</p>
<p>Leonard: All I’m saying is give me a heads-up.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, whatever.</p>
<p>Leonard: And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.</p>
<p>Penny: All right, got it. Is there anything else?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, don’t let Goofy near him. He’ll have nightmares and I’ll have to deal with it.</p>
<p>Penny: What’s the problem with Goofy?</p>
<p>Leonard: Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment. </p>
<p>Raj: Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?</p>
<p>Howard: Well, that’s it. We’re officially out of things to talk about.</p>
<p>Penny: We’re home.</p>
<p>Leonard: It’s ten o’clock, where have you been?</p>
<p>Sheldon: We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.</p>
<p>Leonard: I was going to see that with him.</p>
<p>Penny: How was I supposed to know that?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s all right. I’ll see it again with you.</p>
<p>Leonard: And I have food here. You said you were going to call.</p>
<p>Penny: I know, I know.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I can still eat.</p>
<p>Penny: No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Okay, but just don’t fight</p>
<p>Leonard: We’re not fighting.</p>
<p>Penny: Just go.</p>
<p>Leonard: Aren’t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Thank you, Penny.</p>
<p>Penny: You’re welcome, sweetie.</p>
<p>Leonard: Want a cup of coffee?</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, um, I should probably get going.</p>
<p>Leonard: Come on. It’s just a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Penny: Yep, okay.</p>
<p>Howard (to Raj, who has whispered to him): Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.</p>
<p>Leonard: What am I smelling?</p>
<p>Penny: Sheldon’s churro on my shoes.</p>
<p>Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.</p>
<p>Penny: He’s such an angel when he’s asleep.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.</p>
<p>Penny: I think we can do it.</p>
<p>Leonard: Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?</p>
<p>Penny: No, be friends. You and me.</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh. Sure. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Penny: Good. I’m glad.</p>
<p>Leonard: Here’s an idea. I’m just throwing it out there, friends who have s*x.</p>
<p>Penny: Good night, Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin’ around.</p>
<p>Sheldon (in his sleep): No, Goofy, no.</p>
