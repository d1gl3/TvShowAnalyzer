		<p>Scene: The Apartment.</p>
<p>Raj: Howard’s capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.</p>
<p>Leonard: It’ll be good to have him back.</p>
<p>Raj: The Fantastic Four reunited.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We’ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard’s gym membership.</p>
<p>Raj: We’re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you’re the tiebreaker.</p>
<p>Leonard: I don’t have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, I don’t sell my friendship that cheaply.</p>
<p>Stuart: I can go thirty.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Welcome aboard, old chum.</p>
<p>Raj: Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard’s final descent has begun.</p>
<p>Sheldon: He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.</p>
<p>Scene: The Soyuz Capsule. Howard is screaming.</p>
<p>Dimitri: Loops, calm down!</p>
<p>Howard (singing): Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz</p>
<p>Mike: What’s that?</p>
<p>Howard: The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don’t have one for falling out of space! We did it! We’re on the ground! We survived!</p>
<p>Mike: That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go. (Howard screams again)</p>
<p>Credits sequence.</p>
<p>Scene: The Airport Arrivals Hall.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Waiting for my husband.</p>
<p>Man in Suit: That’s nice.</p>
<p>Bernadette: He’s coming back from outer space.</p>
<p>Man in Suit: I think this flight’s coming from Houston.</p>
<p>Bernadette: No, I mean, he… Never mind. There he is! Howie!</p>
<p>Various others (all at once): Howie! Howie!</p>
<p>Howard: Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.</p>
<p>Howie Mandel: Uh, I think they’re here for me, Ringo.</p>
<p>Man in Suit: Mr. Mandel, I’m your driver.</p>
<p>Howie Mandel: Oh, thanks. That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he’s an astronaut.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I missed you so much.</p>
<p>Howard: I missed you, too. Where are the guys?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Oh, it’s just me.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, I get it. They’re waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don’t worry, I can act surprised. (Does)</p>
<p>Bernadette: No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me. (Sneezes) </p>
<p>Howard: Gesundheit. You okay?</p>
<p>Bernadette: I am now that you’re back. Come on, let’s go home so I can tear off those little pants.</p>
<p>Howard: Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment. </p>
<p>Sheldon: You know, I am very disappointed that I won’t be able to celebrate Howard’s accomplishment tonight.</p>
<p>Amy: Me, too. But we’ll see him tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yes, it’s just that in all the years I’ve known him, he’s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.</p>
<p>Penny: You’re unbelievable.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I know.</p>
<p>Leonard: All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?</p>
<p>Penny: How about boys versus girls?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I’m not on has a decided disadvantage.</p>
<p>Penny: Once again, unbelievable.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yeah, once again, I know.</p>
<p>Penny: All right, round one. Here.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Got it.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay. Ready, set, go.</p>
<p>Amy: Uh, box? Uh, window?</p>
<p>Leonard: Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.</p>
<p>Amy: Uh, gift? Uh, Present!</p>
<p>Penny: Present! Yeah!</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?</p>
<p>Leonard: In what universe is that a present?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s not a present, it’s the present. Look. There’s you and me. There’s Penny and Amy. We’re playing Pictionary. In the present.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, my God, we’re gonna kill them.</p>
<p>Later</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s a quark-gluon plasma.</p>
<p>Leonard: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.</p>
<p>Leonard: Nothing with quarks.</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.</p>
<p>Leonard: No.</p>
<p>Penny: It’s a chocolate chip cookie.</p>
<p>Amy: Yes.</p>
<p>Leonard: How could you miss that?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.</p>
<p>Leonard: Penny got it.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You’re welcome.</p>
<p>Later</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.</p>
<p>Amy: Penny, aren’t you gonna draw something?</p>
<p>Penny: Relax, we got time, this is so fun.</p>
<p>Sheldon: There.</p>
<p>Leonard: A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don’t…</p>
<p>Amy: Now?</p>
<p>Penny: Soon.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.</p>
<p>Leonard: I don’t know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?</p>
<p>Penny: All right, that’s enough. (Draws)</p>
<p>Amy: Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?</p>
<p>Penny: Yep!</p>
<p>Sheldon: Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn’t enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.</p>
<p>Penny: Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.</p>
<p>Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s Bedroom.</p>
<p>Howard: Bernie, you okay?</p>
<p>Bernadette (off): Yeah, I’ll be right there. (Hacking and coughing noises)</p>
<p>Howard: Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?</p>
<p>Bernadette: It’s just allergies.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Took some Benadryl. I’ll be fine. So, did you miss me?</p>
<p>Howard: Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every…</p>
<p>Bernadette (has a coughing fit): Ew. Excuse me.</p>
<p>Howard: Sweetie, we don’t have to do this now.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Howard: You okay?</p>
<p>Bernadette: A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Now, kiss me. (He does. She starts snoring)</p>
<p>Howard: Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?</p>
<p>Bernadette (waking suddenly): That was amazing. You made me feel things I never… (starts snoring again)</p>
<p>Howard: Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment. </p>
<p>Penny: Hey, Sheldon, you’re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Don’t know.</p>
<p>Penny: I wonder if it’s from, like, ancient Rome where they’d actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.</p>
<p>Leonard: Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It’s a pretty well-rounded game.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Lot of big talk from a man who can’t draw a chocolate chip cookie.</p>
<p>Penny: All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.</p>
<p>Sheldon: All right. Let’s play Physics Fiesta.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, come on, what is that?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, ¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?</p>
<p>Leonard: En el acelerador de particulares.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Bueno, mi amigo.</p>
<p>Penny: No, no, we’re not playing some dumb made-up game.</p>
<p>Sheldon: All games are made up. They’re not found in nature. You don’t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock’em Sock’em Robots.</p>
<p>Leonard: Just pick another game.</p>
<p>Amy: Why don’t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?</p>
<p>Leonard: No good, Sheldon doesn’t float.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.</p>
<p>Amy: All right, let’s keep it simple. How about darts?</p>
<p>Sheldon: No, that’s not fair either.</p>
<p>Penny: Why not?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Darts is a bar game. You’ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, that’s when it started.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they’re all out.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I’ve won a few, but that’s just because I spill when I’m drunk, so…</p>
<p>Amy: We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.</p>
<p>Sheldon: No.</p>
<p>Leonard: Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Penny: I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Amy: Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn’t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.</p>
<p>Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s House.</p>
<p>Howard: Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain’s on the door.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard? I thought I wasn’t going to see you till tomorrow.</p>
<p>Howard: Yeah, well, Bernie’s not feeling well, so I thought I’d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I’m not decent.</p>
<p>Howard: All right. Woman hasn’t tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she’s not decent?</p>
<p>Man’s Voice (off): You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): Shh, you need to whisper.</p>
<p>Howard: Ma, who is in there?</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): Uh, nobody. The TV is on.</p>
<p>Man’s Voice (off): I only got one sock. Where’s my other sock?</p>
<p>Howard: Who is that?</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): I told you, it’s the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it’s hilarious.</p>
<p>Howard: If you’re busy, I can come back.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.</p>
<p>Howard (to man climbing out window): Dr. Schneider?</p>
<p>Dr Schneider: Oh, hello, Howard.</p>
<p>Howard: What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Dr Schneider: Um, house call.</p>
<p>Howard: You’re a dentist.</p>
<p>Dr Schneider: Yes, yes, I am. I think he’s on to us.</p>

<p>Scene: The apartment.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Hurry up, find him, find him.</p>
<p>Leonard: I’m trying. Don’t yell at me.</p>
<p>Sheldon: For goodness’ sake, he’s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.</p>
<p>Leonard: I know what he looks like.</p>
<p>Amy: Oh, there he is, I got him.</p>
<p>Penny: Yes, we win again.</p>
<p>Sheldon: How could you not find him?</p>
<p>Leonard: Because he’s hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There’s Waldo.</p>
<p>Later. Penny and Sheldon have their foreheads on light sabres and are spinning.</p>
<p>Leonard: 57, 58, 59, that’s one minute.</p>
<p>Amy: Long division, long division. Go, go, go.</p>
<p>Leonard: Remember, show your work.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m okay. I’m okay. I’m not okay.</p>
<p>Leonard: Get up, we can’t lose at math.</p>
<p>Penny: 37.</p>
<p>Amy: Yes.</p>
<p>Later </p>
<p>Amy: Ready, set, wrestle. (Penny pins Sheldon straight away) One, two, three, pin.</p>
<p>Penny: Mwah!</p>
<p>Sheldon: Stop that.</p>
<p>Penny: Mwah!</p>
<p>Sheldon: Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.</p>
<p>Scene: Raj’s apartment.</p>
<p>Howard: One to beam aboard?</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, my God, you’re back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.</p>
<p>Howard: Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I’m like an inch and a half taller. I’m going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn’t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Howard: Yeah, well, Bernadette’s a little under the weather and my mom’s kind of under my dentist.</p>
<p>Raj: Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?</p>
<p>Howard: Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.</p>
<p>Raj: So you’re wandering all around by yourself? That’s not the kind of hero’s welcome an astronaut should come home to.</p>
<p>Howard: It’s okay, you know, we space cowboys don’t do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.</p>
<p>Stuart: Oh, hey, man, welcome back.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Stuart: I, I kind of live here now.</p>
<p>Raj: Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.</p>
<p>Stuart: Ah, he’s spoiling me and I love it.</p>
<p>Howard: Wow, so you guys are like buds now?</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.</p>
<p>Stuart: Plus, he doesn’t have a girlfriend, I don’t have a girlfriend.</p>
<p>Raj: It’s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other’s holes.</p>
<p>Stuart: Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.</p>
<p>Raj: Which part?</p>
<p>Stuart: Just all of it.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?</p>
<p>Stuart: Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.</p>
<p>Howard: Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that’s cool.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, Howard, it’s still our thing. Come with us, we’ll, we’ll get you a scalped ticket.</p>
<p>Howard: So I’d be sitting by myself?</p>
<p>Raj: We’ll switch. You’ll come sit with me after intermission.</p>
<p>Stuart: So I, I, I’d be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?</p>
<p>Howard: No, no, you guys go. Have fun.</p>
<p>Raj: Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?</p>
<p>Howard: Absolutely. See you, Stuart.</p>
<p>Stuart: Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?</p>
<p>Howard: At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment. </p>
<p>Penny: All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.</p>
<p>Amy: On the count of three. One, two…</p>
<p>Sheldon: Wait. I’m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.</p>
<p>Leonard: So?</p>
<p>Sheldon: So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?</p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon, we haven’t won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I’m gonna stick that pie in your face.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That’s rude.</p>
<p>Amy: One, two, three, eat.</p>
<p>Howard: Hey, guys, guess who’s back from space.</p>
<p>All: Not now!</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!</p>
<p>Leonard: Snort it down and keep eating!</p>
<p>Scene: A diner.</p>
<p>Waitress: You look familiar.</p>
<p>Howard: I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Waitress: Yeah, I just saw you on the news. You’re an astronaut.</p>
<p>Howard: Yes. Yes, I am.</p>
<p>Waitress: Good for you. How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, thank you so much. I’ve been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don’t care, my wife’s sick, I went to my mom…</p>
<p>Waitress: You want the cheesecake or not?</p>
<p>Howard: Yes, please. (Sings) And I think it’s gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me ’round again to find I’m not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I’m a rocket man. (Sneezes) Perfect.</p>
