		<p>Scene: The apartment. Sheldon has a series of whiteboards across the room.</p>
<p>Leonard: Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?</p>
<p>Sheldon: The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yes.</p>
<p>Sheldon: And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yes.</p>
<p>Sheldon: What I’m doing here is trying to determine when I’m going to die.</p>
<p>Leonard: A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?</p>
<p>Sheldon: My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.</p>
<p>Leonard: Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Killed by badger.</p>
<p>Leonard: How’s that?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there’s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.</p>
<p>Leonard: I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that I don’t share that flawed DNA?</p>
<p>Leonard: You can always get a badger and find out.</p>
<p>Sheldon: But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.</p>
<p>Leonard: That long, huh?</p>
<p>Sheldon: 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.</p>
<p>Leonard: What’s there?</p>
<p>Sheldon: The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.</p>
<p>Leonard: So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?</p>
<p>Sheldon: By this much.</p>
<p>Leonard: Tough break. You want eggs?</p>
<p>Sheldon: You don’t get it, Leonard. I’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory, cold fusion, the dogapus.</p>
<p>Leonard: What’s a dogapus?</p>
<p>Sheldon: A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best friend.</p>
<p>Leonard: Is somebody working on that?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.</p>
<p>Leonard: Wait a minute. You hate dogs.</p>
<p>Sheldon: A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.</p>
<p>Credits sequence.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment.</p>
<p>Howard: What do we owe you?</p>
<p>Leonard: It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.</p>
<p>Howard: Here you go.</p>
<p>Leonard: Thank you.</p>
<p>Penny: What?</p>
<p>Leonard: Never mind. I got it.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, you wanted me to pay.</p>
<p>Leonard: It’s no big deal.</p>
<p>Penny: No, no, no, no. You’re right. We’re not going out anymore, I should pay for myself. (After Raj whispers to Howard, and Howard laughs) What?</p>
<p>Howard: He said if he had woman parts, he’d eat for free the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. I’m a little low on cash.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hmm? How much you got?</p>
<p>Penny: Nothing.</p>
<p>Leonard: How can you walk around with no money?</p>
<p>Penny: I’m cute. I get by.</p>
<p>Leonard: It’s okay, you can owe me.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay.</p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon, six bucks.</p>
<p>Sheldon: No, thank you. I’m not eating pizza tonight.</p>
<p>Penny: But it’s Thursday. Thursday’s pizza night.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts.</p>
<p>Howard: Really? You’re changing the Sheldonian calendar?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s a small price to pay.</p>
<p>Penny: For what?</p>
<p>Leonard: No, no, don’t ask.</p>
<p>Penny: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Sheldon: In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.</p>
<p>Penny: Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Correct.</p>
<p>Penny: So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Essentially, yes.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, here’s my question. Didn’t you already do that?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Flattering, but sadly, no. I’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.</p>
<p>Penny: Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Certainly. I’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.</p>
<p>Howard (after Raj whispers to him): You’re right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That’s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.</p>
<p>Penny: No, it won’t. Um, how does he know I jog?</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, my God, that is so creepy!</p>
<p>Howard: I know! (Raj whispers to him) And he says he’s not gonna stop. (Raj whispers to him urgently) Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.</p>
<p>Scene: Leonard’s bedroom</p>
<p>Sheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) U-u-ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) Lenu-u-ugh.</p>
<p>Leonard: What the hell? What’s the matter?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I’m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.</p>
<p>Leonard: There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.</p>
<p>Leonard: When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!</p>
<p>Leonard: Have you had your appendix out?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I haven’t. I’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?</p>
<p>Leonard: Let’s get you to the hospital.</p>
<p>Sheldon: So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?</p>
<p>Leonard: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I do. And yet I’m doomed while you live on.</p>
<p>Leonard: Funny how things work out, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, Lord, I think it’s about to burst! (Loud sound of farting) On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.</p>
<p>Leonard: Good night.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.</p>
<p>Scene: The hallway.</p>
<p>Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.</p>
<p>Penny: Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Thank you. They’re my mother’s.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you’re gonna run really fast?</p>
<p>Sheldon: No, the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday, but it’s nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?</p>
<p>Penny: I don’t have one.</p>
<p>Sheldon: What about your pedometer?</p>
<p>Penny: Don’t have one.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?</p>
<p>Penny: Uh, no.</p>
<p>Sheldon: What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?</p>
<p>Penny: No. I just run till I’m hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Why are you doing that?</p>
<p>Penny: It’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.</p>
<p>Sheldon: All right.</p>
<p>Penny: All right, let’s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I am doing it.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?</p>
<p>Sheldon: We’ll never know.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, let’s just warm up on the run.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Okay.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yeah, I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!</p>
<p>Penny (squealing): Oh, my God, are you okay?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I think so.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, let me help you up.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Thank you. (Loud sound of farting)</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, Sheldon!</p>
<p>Sheldon: If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment. </p>
<p>Leonard: Here’s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.</p>
<p>Howard: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>Leonard: Palak paneer, that’s Penny.</p>
<p>Penny: Thanks.</p>
<p>Leonard: And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.</p>
<p>Penny: Hey, what’s my share?</p>
<p>Leonard: Uh, 12 bucks.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?</p>
<p>Leonard: Sure.</p>
<p>Penny: What am I up to now?</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Penny (after Raj whispers to Howard and they both laugh): What now?</p>
<p>Howard: He’s just expressing his admiration that you don’t even have to put out to get free stuff.</p>
<p>Penny: It’s not free, I’m gonna pay him back. (Raj whispers. Both laugh again) Shut up!</p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon, are you gonna join us?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Coming! (From the bedroom area, a wheeled device consisting of a base, a tee-shirt on a coat hanger, and a computer monitor with Sheldon’s face, appears). Greetings, friends.</p>
<p>Leonard: Greetings, whatever the hell you are.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.</p>
<p>Howard (after Raj whispers to him): Really? That’s your question? When did he put a ramp in?</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: You’re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, to be honest, I don’t see much difference.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: Thank you. That’s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.</p>
<p>Leonard: This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: You don’t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.</p>
<p>Leonard: You’re in your bedroom.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: No, I’m not.</p>
<p>Leonard: I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: No, you can’t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!</p>
<p>Penny: So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.</p>

<p>Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.</p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m behind you. Please look at me when you’re talking to me.</p>
<p>Leonard: I am looking at you.</p>
<p>Sheldon: No, you’re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.</p>
<p>Leonard: You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.</p>
<p>Sheldon: At my age, do you know how I’m statistically most likely to die?</p>
<p>Leonard: At the hands of your roommate?</p>
<p>Sheldon: An accident.</p>
<p>Leonard: That’s how I’m going to make it look.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.</p>
<p>Leonard: Fine, but don’t expect my help.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement.</p>
<p>Leonard: No, it’s not.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.</p>
<p>Leonard: I’ll be damned.</p>
<p>Scene: Leonard’s car</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: This is delightful.</p>
<p>Leonard: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: It’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.</p>
<p>Leonard: Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the trunk?</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: Because I called shotgun. Remember?</p>
<p>Leonard: Right.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.</p>
<p>Leonard: I don’t want to listen to music, Sheldon.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: Very well. I don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we’re like Knight Rider.</p>
<p>Leonard: Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?</p>
<p>Leonard: I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: Perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.</p>
<p>Leonard: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I’ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I’ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.</p>
<p>Leonard: That’s it. Bye-bye. (Turns off screen.)</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot (screen switching itself back on): Bazinga.</p>
<p>Leonard: Whoa!</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: I have an override switch.</p>
<p>Leonard: I almost died!</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : And I’m safe and sound in bed. Who’s crazy now?</p>
<p>Leonard: I’m still going to go with you.</p>
<p>Scene: A corridor at the university.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door.</p>
<p>Leonard: What about it?</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : Be a lamb and open it for me.</p>
<p>Leonard: Why? What’s the problem?</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : You think you have me stymied, don’t you?</p>
<p>Leonard: No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, look, it’s Leonard and R2-D-Bag.</p>
<p>Raj: That’s my joke. I told it last night. You can’t just use it.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, sure.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : He’s a lamb. You’re not.</p>
<p>Raj: I’m a lamb.</p>
<p>Scene: The Cheesecake Factory</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : Isn’t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.</p>
<p>Howard: I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.</p>
<p>Raj: That’s two, dude. Write your own jokes.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, great. Hi, I’m Penny, I’ll be your waitress.</p>
<p>Leonard: Why are you introducing yourself?</p>
<p>Penny: I’d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : Can you tell me the specials this evening?</p>
<p>Penny: Sheldon, I’m not waiting on you.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: Obviously. I don’t even have water yet.</p>
<p>Penny: Because you’re not here.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: That’s discrimination against the otherwise located. I’m going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.</p>
<p>Howard: Is that Steve Wozniak?</p>
<p>Leonard: I think it is.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : The Great and Powerful Woz.</p>
<p>Leonard: Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : I must speak to him.</p>
<p>Leonard: Of course you must.</p>
<p>Penny: You know, there’s an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?</p>
<p>Steve Wozniak: Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : Thank you. I just want to say I’m a big fan. You’re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.</p>
<p>Steve Wozniak: Only fifteenth?</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : It’s still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.</p>
<p>Steve Wozniak: Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.</p>
<p>Steve Wozniak: Thanks, we were shooting for nifty. You know, if you had it here, I’d autograph it for you.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: Don’t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.</p>
<p>Steve Wozniak: Nerds.</p>
<p>Scene: The hallway. Sheldon exits carrying the Apple 2.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m coming, Woz, I’m coming. (Trips on stairs.) Ow! Aw.</p>
<p>Scene: The hallway. Sheldon-bot approaches Penny’s door and starts bashing into it.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot : (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny.</p>
<p>Penny: What up, Shel-Bot?</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: I can’t get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.</p>
<p>Penny: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: Sing me Soft Kitty.</p>
<p>Penny: Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?</p>
<p>Penny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: Closer to the microphone.</p>
<p>Penny: Happy kitty, sleepy…</p>
<p>Sheldon-bot: No. You have to start over.</p>
<p>Penny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.</p>
