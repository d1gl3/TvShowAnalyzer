		<p>Scene: The stairwell.</p>
<p>Leonard: So you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, that’s very interesting.</p>
<p>Leonard: It’s also not pink and has no berries.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question.</p>
<p>Leonard: What was your question again?</p>
<p>Penny: Do you want some.</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, right, no, I’m lactose intolerant.</p>
<p>Penny: Right.</p>
<p>Leonard: So, gas.</p>
<p>Penny: Got it.</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, good night. (They kiss. Camera cuts away to a wall mounted security cam above the lift. Leonard spots its movement and shuffles Penny away.)</p>
<p>Penny: What are you doing?</p>
<p>Leonard: There was a draft.</p>
<p>Penny: I didn’t feel a draft.</p>
<p>Leonard: Why don’t we just go into your….</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.</p>
<p>Leonard: No, no, I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast.</p>
<p>Penny: No, I know, I… I know what you meant, it’s just… it’s only our first date.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.</p>
<p>Penny: Or we could just wing it.</p>
<p>Leonard: That might work too.</p>
<p>Penny: Goodnight Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: Goodnight. (He throws the camera a dirty look.) </p>
<p>Cut to inside the apartment.</p>
<p>Raj: He’s coming. Screen saver.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?</p>
<p>Leonard: Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?</p>
<p>Sheldon: They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.</p>
<p>Howard: You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box.</p>
<p>Leonard: What are you talking about, the date went fine.</p>
<p>Raj: Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.</p>
<p>Leonard: Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It’s like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow down and savour it.”</p>
<p>Howard: No, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to slow down and spit it out.”</p>
<p>Raj: You being the fish.</p>
<p>Leonard: I’m not the fish.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh really, did you make a second date.</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, we sort of decided to wing it.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, even I know that’s lame.</p>
<p>Leonard: Okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong.</p>
<p>Howard: Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I’m getting into.</p>
<p>Leonard: I didn’t say anything like that.</p>
<p>Howard: Good, ‘cos they don’t work.</p>
<p>Raj: They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that’s my home run swing.</p>
<p>Leonard: Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.</p>
<p>Howard: Let’s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.</p>
<p>Raj: Nice close up, by the way.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.</p>
<p>Leonard: That’s not a bad sign.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.</p>
<p>Raj: And the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there.</p>
<p>Leonard: I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera.</p>
<p>Raj: He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.</p>
<p>Howard: Give him time.</p>
<p>Credits sequence</p>
<p>Scene: The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts. </p>
<p>Penny (entering): Hi.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates.</p>
<p>Penny (tipping all her laundry into one machine at once): Thanks.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?</p>
<p>Penny: Sheldon, may I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as to forbid it.</p>
<p>Penny: Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.</p>
<p>Penny: No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn’t a braniac?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature.</p>
<p>Penny: How is that not a braniac?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature.</p>
<p>Penny: So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That depends.</p>
<p>Penny: On what?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?</p>
<p>Penny: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Do you speak Klingon?</p>
<p>Penny: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Do you know any card tricks?</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Why would you lie about that?</p>
<p>Penny: Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid loser.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?</p>
<p>Penny: You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yeah, but you were neither.</p>
<p>Penny: Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You’re asking me to keep a secret?</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.</p>
<p>Penny: What?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility. (Long pause.) It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Physiologically impossible.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh Sheldon, please, look, I’m asking you as a friend.</p>
<p>Sheldon: So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?</p>
<p>Penny: Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?</p>
<p>Scene: The stairwell.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I.e, I couldn’t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.</p>
<p>Leonard: You could be Batman?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Sure. (In a gravelly voice) I’m Batman. See.</p>
<p>Penny (arriving): Hi guys.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hey.</p>
<p>Sheldon (looking the other way uncomfortably): Hi Penny.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hey, Penny, if you’re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.</p>
<p>Leonard: What about Saturday?</p>
<p>Penny: You know, I’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.</p>
<p>Leonard: Great. So you just let me know when you know. So… (she leaves) Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things. (Runs away.) </p>
<p>Leonard (chasing him): What does that mean?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.</p>
<p>Leonard: No I didn’t.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir.</p>
<p>Leonard: What’s going on with you?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak. (His eye begins to twitch.) </p>
<p>Leonard: What’s wrong with your face?</p>
<p>Sheldon: There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: What?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I said Good Day! (He leaves)</p>
<p>Leonard: Good day?</p>
<p>Scene: The Cheesecake Factory</p>
<p>Penny: Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day…</p>
<p>Sheldon (appearing behind her): You must release me from my oath.</p>
<p>Penny: Sheldon, I’m working.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Why don’t you take a minute to decide (leads her away)I can’t keep your secret Penny. I’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.</p>
<p>Penny: Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment.</p>
<p>Sheldon (entering): Leonard, I’m moving out.</p>
<p>Leonard: What do you mean, you’re moving out? Why?</p>
<p>Sheldon: There doesn’t have to be a reason.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, there kind of does.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., I’m moving out because I’m moving out.</p>
<p>Leonard: I’m still confused.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Leonard, I don’t see how I could have made it any simpler.</p>
<p>Howard (entering): Hey, qu’est q’wass up?</p>
<p>Raj: We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.</p>
<p>Howard: And some of those skinless chicks were hot.</p>
<p>Sheldon: If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pack.</p>
<p>Howard: That’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.</p>
<p>Leonard: It’s not you, Howard, he says he’s moving out.</p>
<p>Raj: What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?</p>
<p>Leonard: No.</p>
<p>Raj: Did you take a band aid off in front of him?</p>
<p>Leonard: No.</p>
<p>Howard: Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?</p>
<p>Raj: Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often?</p>
<p>Leonard: No.</p>
<p>Howard: Did you make fun of trains?</p>
<p>Leonard: I didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane.</p>
<p>Raj: Well, we all knew this day was coming.</p>
<p>Leonard: That was fast.</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.</p>
<p>Leonard: Where are you gonna live?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.</p>
<p>Howard: Bye (runs out.) </p>
<p>Raj: Well you can’t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?</p>
<p>Raj: I hate trains.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Don’t be ridiculous, you love trains.</p>
<p>Raj: Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard. (Sheldon drops keys in bowl and leaves without a word.)</p>
<p>Leonard: This could work.</p>

<p>Scene: Raj’s apartment. </p>
<p>Sheldon: This is a very old building.</p>
<p>Raj: Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Raj: What?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?</p>
<p>Raj: Not until now.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I can’t believe I didn’t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn’t pack it.</p>
<p>Raj: Well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon…</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo.</p>
<p>Raj: Terrific.</p>
<p>Sheldon (referring to Bollywood singing on television): Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?</p>
<p>Raj: Yes, isn’t she an amazing actress.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Actually, I’d say she’s a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit.</p>
<p>Raj: How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Obviously you’re not that familiar with Indian cinema.</p>
<p>Scene: Howard’s house. The door rings. </p>
<p>Howard: Who is it?</p>
<p>Voice: Strippergram. (Howard opens door. Outside are Raj and Sheldon.)</p>
<p>Raj: Tag. You’re it. (Runs away.) </p>
<p>Howard: Shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?</p>
<p>Scene: Howard’s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.</p>
<p>Howard: Maybe you’d be happier on a park bench?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.</p>
<p>Howard: Do you want to switch?</p>
<p>Sheldon: No, that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.</p>
<p>Howard: Get out of bed, we’re switching.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Now, only if you want to.</p>
<p>Howard: Just get in the bed!</p>
<p>Howard’s mother (off): What’s going on? Are you boys roughhousing?</p>
<p>Howard: We’re just talking ma.</p>
<p>Howard’s mother: If you don’t settle down right now, I’m not going to let you have any more sleepovers.</p>
<p>Howard: For God’s sake, ma, I’m 27 years old. It’s not even a school night! (To Sheldon) Comfy now?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Meh. That poster of Halle Berry’s a little unnerving.</p>
<p>Howard: So don’t look at it.</p>
<p>Sheldon: She’s like my fourth favourite catwoman.</p>
<p>Howard: No kidding?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her.</p>
<p>Howard: What about Lee Meriwether?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.</p>
<p>Howard: Well I’m glad that’s settled.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There’s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether…</p>
<p>Howard: Please, I’m begging you, go to sleep.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m trying, I’m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh for God’s sake.</p>
<p>Sheldon: But she’s not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel….</p>
<p>Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment. There is an urgent rapping at the door.</p>
<p>Leonard: I’m coming! (Opens the door. Sheldon falls inside, wearing his pyjamas. Howard is outside.)</p>
<p>Sheldon: Hey, there he is, there’s my old buddy-bud-bud.</p>
<p>Leonard: What’s with him?</p>
<p>Howard: Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn’t get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom’s valium in it. But he still wouldn’t shut up, so, tag, you’re it.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m ba-ack!</p>
<p>Leonard: I still don’t know why you left.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p>Leonard: Why not.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I promised Penny.</p>
<p>Leonard: You promised Penny what?</p>
<p>Sheldon: That I wouldn’t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!</p>
<p>Leonard: What secret. Tell me the secret.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can’t tell Dad.</p>
<p>Leonard: Not that secret, the other secret.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m Batman. Shhhhh!</p>
<p>Leonard: Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Okay, I’ll tell you, but you can’t tell Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: I promise.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: So it’s nothing I did? It’s her problem?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I drank milk that tasted funny.</p>
<p>Leonard: Penny thinks I’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don’t worry, that’s not a secret. Everybody knows.</p>
<p>Scene: The hallway. Leonard is outside Penny’s door.</p>
<p>Penny (opening door): Hi.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, hi, listen, I know what’s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.</p>
<p>Penny: What are you talking about.</p>
<p>Leonard: First I want to say that it’s not Sheldon’s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.</p>
<p>Penny: He told you?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yes, but it’s okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there’s a simple solution. (Hands her a brochure.) </p>
<p>Penny: Pasadena city college?</p>
<p>Leonard: A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a paralegal.</p>
<p>Penny: Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree.</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city college.</p>
<p>Penny: Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?</p>
<p>Leonard: That doesn’t matter to me at all.</p>
<p>Penny: So, it’s fine with you if I’m not smart.</p>
<p>Leonard: Absolutely. (She slams the door in his face.) Okay, this time I know where I went wrong. (Looking up and seeing the camera) Oh bite me!</p>
