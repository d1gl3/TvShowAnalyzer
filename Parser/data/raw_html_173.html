<p>Scene:  Amy's laboratory ]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I've invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn't deserve his own joke.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: Is that really true?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: Hey, sowwy to intewupt.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: Did you know Edison didn't actuawy invent the wight bulb?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: What do you want, Barry?</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: What's this for?</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper's onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: Well, that's fascinating. I can't wait to read it.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: Well, I'd been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it's not a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn't you try to help me?</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: That's pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn't mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: Sheldon, we're all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You're being petty.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I'm being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?</p>

Season 8 Episode 15<br />
<strong>The Comic Book Store Regeneration</strong><br />
Original Air Date on February 19, 2015</p>
<hr />
<p>Scene:  Howard and Bernadette's apartment ]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Howard</strong> <em>(on phone)</em>: Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: Your mom having fun in Florida?</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: She's just being nice.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Well, I'm her son, how come she doesn't send someone to check on me if I'm lonely?</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: Because you have a wife.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: I know you don't like Stuart being in the house, but the store's about to reopen, I'm sure he'll get back on his feet.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: That would be great. I'd love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: Well, normal's a strong word, but sure.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scene:  The laundry room ]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: If I was okay, I would've said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I'm mad at Amy.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Oh, that sounds like a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I'm sorry you had to see that.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Why would she do this to me?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Well, I'm sure she didn't upset you on purpose. Besides, aren't you the one who says there's nothing more important than the advancement of science?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: No, I said there's nothing more important than me advancing science.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: All right, well, if I'm understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I'm thinking you might have to let this one go.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it's my fault, and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: I don't know what to tell you. I mean, why don't you talk to her?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life's giving me lemons. What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Well, you could shove them somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Okay, now you're getting creative.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scene:  The comic book store ]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: Thanks again for your help.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Our pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: The place really looks great.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: I keep telling you I didn't burn it down.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: Stuart, this place looks amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: You really did a nice job.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom's through all this. I couldn't have done it otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: I appreciate that, and I'm glad you were able to... is that my mother's furniture?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn't it look great?</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: Howie.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Why don't you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: What is your problem? She said it was okay.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Well, I'm her son, and I say it's not okay.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Well, maybe I should've gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy's mother.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: Why don't we leave so you can cool off?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: I think that's a good idea. Take him out of my store.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I'm not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Why don't we go get the food for the party.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Smart, looks like we're being helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Mmm, when really we're just exiting an uncomfortable situation.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scene:  Penny's apartment ]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I'm so... Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: I don't know, just think about something else.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Can I think about the spiny anteater?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn't help at all.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: You know, some people try visualization.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: How does that work?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Now imagine you're holding that pen.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Now open your hand and let it go.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: But I just got this pen. It's got my initials on it and everything. Look.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Sheldon, this isn't that hard.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I may have a better way that you can teach me.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: What? She didn't give me any puzzles.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>Amy (in flashback)</strong>: Boy, I just can't seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?</p>
<p><strong>Amy (in flashback)</strong>: Darn it. There's something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?</p>
<p><strong>Amy (in flashback)</strong>: Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it's stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Okay, that's great. Now, let it go.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: I can't believe you were testing me against a chimp.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Why would she even do this?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: She's been conducting an experiment on apes where they're given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn't be able to solve them. That's when Amy said, want to make this interesting?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Make this interesting? You bet money on me?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn't that interesting?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: It's not interesting. It's incredibly insulting.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you're holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that'll make the next part really hard.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Oh, my, that's it. Get out.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I don't understand why you're mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Penny?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I think I left my pen in there.</p>

<hr />
<p>Scene:  The comic book store ]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: I understand why you're upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it's just furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: It's my mom's furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother's house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: That is a good point. But I didn't marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I'm being.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scene:  A deli ]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Hi, we're here to pick up an order for Comic Center.</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: Sure, let me go check on that.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Dude, I, I think that's Nathan Fillion.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Oh yeah, look at that.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: And he's picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart's store, that would be amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: That would be great.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: So should we go talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: I don't know. I mean, if he's not nice, it's gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: I was distracted. It's weird seeing a member of the Night's Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don't mean to bother you, but we're just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Fillion</strong>: Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I'm not an actor.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Don't say that. I mean, you're not Dame Judi Dench, but you're pretty great.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Fillion</strong>: Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I'm Nathan Fillion, but I'm not. So if you don't mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Come on. Sorry to bother you.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Don't know why he's so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I'm still floating.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scene:  The hallway ]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: Sheldon, it's me.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I'll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: I know you've been giving me secret puzzle tests.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: Sheldon, open the door.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I can't. I'm naked.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: I just saw you.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Open the door now.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: Oh, hey.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Pull up your pants.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: It's not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: I don't want five dollars. I want my dignity.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?</p>
<hr />
<p>Scene:  The deli ]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Sorry again.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Fillion</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Are you sure you're not him? Uh, you can tell us. We're scientists, not crazy fanboys.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Fillion</strong>: All right, fine. I'm him.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: And you're eating alone at a deli. I don't buy it, you're not him.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Fillion</strong>: I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let's take a picture.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: That would be great.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Fillion</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Wait, hang on. If you're really Nathan Fillion, what's the line from Firefly about your bonnet?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Fillion</strong>: I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: That's it, that's the line.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Although, I knew the line, doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Fillion</strong>: Do you want the picture or not?</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan</strong>: How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Ah, it's good enough for Facebook.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scene:  The comic book store ]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: I can't believe they did that.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: I know, it's so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Really? You couldn't get it out?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: Wow, the store looks great.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Eh, what's the matter with them is they think they're so smart they don't care if they hurt other people's feelings.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: That's not true.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: That sounds like us. I still don't understand why you're upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: I'm sorry, but it's making me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: Can you please just let it go?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Hold that thought. (On phone) Hello?</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: How can I make this up to you?</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: The answer's in this puzzle box. Let's see if you can open it.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: You could have at least warned him about the furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: That's what I said when we moved it.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: You helped him?</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Hey, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: What's wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: My mom died.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.</p>
<p><strong>Bernadette</strong>: Oh, my God, Howie.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: I'm so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: What can we do?</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: May I say something?</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Not right now, Sheldon.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: But I think it would be comforting.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>Howard</strong>: No, it's okay. What?</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: When I lost my own father, I didn't have any friends to help me through it. You do.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: I really thought he was gonna say let it go.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scene:  The apartment ]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Raj</strong> <em>(on phone)</em>: Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they've booked a flight. They're heading to the airport now.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: How's Howard holding up?</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: He's hanging in there.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: How are you doing, Stuart?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: Still can't believe she's gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn't for her, I, I would have been homeless.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: One of us would have taken you in.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart</strong>: Yeah, I don't recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I'm glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.</p>
<p><strong>Raj</strong>: Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Whenever I saw her, she'd say I was too skinny and try and feed me.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: She did that to me, too.</p>
<p><strong>Penny</strong>: Don't take this away from me.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: I didn't care for her yelling. But now that I'm not going to hear it again, I'm sad.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: If you want, I can yell at you later.</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon</strong>: It won't be as good.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Let's have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We'll miss you.</p>
