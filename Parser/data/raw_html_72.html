		<p>Scene: The apartment. </p>
<p>Sheldon: Clarify something for me. Isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?</p>
<p>Leonard: It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.</p>
<p>Leonard: Great.</p>
<p>Sheldon: What is the best number? By the way, there’s only one correct answer.</p>
<p>Raj: Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Wrong. The best number is 73. You’re probably wondering why.</p>
<p>Leonard: No.</p>
<p>Howard: Uh-uh.</p>
<p>Raj: We’re good.</p>
<p>Sheldon: 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?</p>
<p>Leonard: We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.</p>
<p>Raj: Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies.</p>
<p>Leonard: Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?</p>
<p>Howard: Yeah, I get it now.</p>
<p>Scene: A bar.</p>
<p>Penny: I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It’s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.</p>
<p>Amy: Did you know that the iconic Valentine’s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I’s with little asses? Cool.</p>
<p>Zack: Hey, Penny, how’s it going?</p>
<p>Penny: Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>Zack: My dad’s company prints the menus for this place. I’m just dropping off some new ones laminated. Makes ‘em easier to clean if people throw up on ‘em. Guess how I got the idea?</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Hi.</p>
<p>Zack: Hey.</p>
<p>Amy: Hoo.</p>
<p>Zack: Okay, well, it was good to see you.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, you, too.</p>
<p>Bernadette: He’s really cute. How do you know him?</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, we went out a couple of times.</p>
<p>Amy: I’m often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Yes.</p>
<p>Penny: No, no. But in this case, yes.</p>
<p>Amy: Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?</p>
<p>Penny: No, it was great. He just didn’t really challenge me on an intellectual level.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?</p>
<p>Penny: Wouldn’t help. Zack can’t even spell NPR.</p>
<p>Bernadette: It’s what I do with Howard. I’m much smarter than he is. But it’s important to protect his manhood.</p>
<p>Amy: Hoo.</p>
<p>Bernadette: What’s the matter?</p>
<p>Amy: I’m suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, we know what’s causing that, don’t we?</p>
<p>Amy: It’s no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette’s syndrome.</p>
<p>Credits sequence. </p>
<p>Scene: The university cafeteria.</p>
<p>Howard: Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?</p>
<p>Leonard: No. What happened?</p>
<p>Howard: They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.</p>
<p>Raj: Did he get superpowers?</p>
<p>Howard: No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh. Well, that’s disappointing.</p>
<p>Howard: Why?</p>
<p>Raj: Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.</p>
<p>Howard: Yeah, but who’d want to become Rat-Man?</p>
<p>Raj: Who wouldn’t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.</p>
<p>Howard: Mouse Boy?</p>
<p>Raj: You don’t like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?</p>
<p>Howard: First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn’t be the sidekick. You’d be the sidekick.</p>
<p>Raj: Rat-Man is nobody’s sidekick.</p>
<p>Howard: Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who’s the obvious sidekick?</p>
<p>Raj: Yeah, Leonard, who?</p>
<p>Leonard: 12 years after high school, and I’m still at the nerd table.</p>
<p>Scene: Amy’s lab. </p>
<p>Sheldon: Aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?</p>
<p>Amy: It’s too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it’s fine.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, you’re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.</p>
<p>Amy: Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Thank you.</p>
<p>Amy: Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.</p>
<p>Amy: No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I’m checking my vital signs every hour.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.</p>
<p>Amy: Oh, that sounds like fun.</p>
<p>Sheldon: All right. What were the symptoms?</p>
<p>Amy: Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Localized to what region?</p>
<p>Amy: Ears and genitalia.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.</p>
<p>Amy: I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny’s friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Who?</p>
<p>Amy: Zack.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Then why did you ask?</p>
<p>Amy: Ask what?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Who.</p>
<p>Amy: Zack.</p>
<p>Sheldon: All right, let’s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?</p>
<p>Amy: Hoo.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Zack.</p>
<p>Amy: Why do you keep saying Zack?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Because you keep saying who.</p>
<p>Amy: I’m not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.</p>
<p>Sheldon: And the answer was Zack, correct?</p>
<p>Amy: There was no question. I simply said hoo.</p>
<p>Sheldon: All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.</p>
<p>Amy: Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?</p>
<p>Scene: The cafeteria. </p>
<p>Howard: There you are.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, hey.</p>
<p>Howard: Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?</p>
<p>Raj: I don’t know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die, and then you do.</p>
<p>Howard: No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.</p>
<p>Raj: Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe…</p>
<p>Howard: Spiders! You’re afraid of spiders!</p>
<p>Raj: What the heck is this?</p>
<p>Howard: A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.</p>
<p>Raj: Are you crazy?</p>
<p>Howard: Perhaps. Are you scared?</p>
<p>Raj: No. But it’s a stupid test.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, come on. That’s never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.</p>
<p>Raj: All right, I will.</p>
<p>Howard: How did you get so brave all of a sudden?</p>
<p>Raj: It’s easy. The spider’s crawling up your arm.</p>
<p>Howard: Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!</p>
<p>Scene: Amy’s lab. </p>
<p>Amy: My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.</p>
<p>Sheldon: How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?</p>
<p>Amy: Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.</p>
<p>Amy: I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny’s friend Zack.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Hang on. I don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.</p>
<p>Amy: Let’s look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.</p>
<p>Sheldon: A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.</p>
<p>Amy: Religion?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Star Trek. Did you see Star Trek: The Motion Picture?</p>
<p>Amy: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Don’t. It’s terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.</p>
<p>Amy: Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Cheap science fiction?</p>
<p>Amy: What are you doing?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.</p>
<p>Amy: Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I hadn’t considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I’ve considered it.</p>
<p>Amy: And?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I reject it.</p>
<p>Amy: You reject it because you don’t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I think I’ll eat my lunch at home.</p>
<p>Amy: That’s not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.</p>

<p>Scene: The laundry room.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Hello.</p>
<p>Penny: Hey. Isn’t tomorrow your usual laundry night?</p>
<p>Sheldon: The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I’ll need time to make things right.</p>
<p>Penny: That’s thinking ahead.</p>
<p>Sheldon: The alternative would be to think backwards. And that’s just remembering.</p>
<p>Penny: So how’s Amy?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Amy’s changed. I might have to let her go.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, no. Why?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.</p>
<p>Penny: Just going to skip over that insult.</p>
<p>Sheldon: What insult?</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah. That’s why I’m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what’s the</p>
<p>scientific word?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Forget science. She’s horny.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh! Okay. Wow.</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s simple biology. There’s nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>Penny: Are you sure?</p>
<p>Sheldon: What are you suggesting?</p>
<p>Penny: I’m suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy’s urges?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s illegal to spay a human being.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah. That’s not what I had in mind.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.</p>
<p>Penny: Exactly.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I’ll let you know what happens.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I’m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I’m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl’s name. No, it doesn’t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I’m calling. I’d like to know if you’d be interested in having s*x with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl’s name. Good grief. It’s like trying to talk to a dolphin.</p>
<p>Scene: A gymnasium. </p>
<p>Leonard: Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?</p>
<p>Howard: You got a better idea?</p>
<p>Leonard: Every idea is better than this idea.</p>
<p>Howard: Ding!</p>
<p>Raj: Wait. What the hell is ding?</p>
<p>Howard: It’s a bell.</p>
<p>Raj: I don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.</p>
<p>Howard: Fine. How do you want to start?</p>
<p>Raj: I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?</p>
<p>Howard: One-two-three-go? That’s for babies.</p>
<p>Raj: Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?</p>
<p>Howard: That’s for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.</p>
<p>Raj: No, it’s chilly outside. Didn’t bring my jacket.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?</p>
<p>Raj: What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights.</p>
<p>Howard: All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.</p>
<p>Raj: Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you’re going to say when we do start, or…</p>
<p>Howard: We’re starting now!</p>
<p>Raj: Don’t yell at me!</p>
<p>Leonard: Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.</p>
<p>Scene: A bar.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?</p>
<p>Amy: I’m sure it’ll wash off.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell’s Angel.</p>
<p>Amy: There’s Zack.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Are you sure this is what you want to do?</p>
<p>Amy: It’s not what I want to do, it’s what I have to do.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.</p>
<p>Amy: Thank you, Sheldon. You’re a good friend.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Please don’t drag this out. This is never going to come off.</p>
<p>Amy: Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs.</p>
<p>Zack: My gluteus what?</p>
<p>Amy: On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack.</p>
<p>Zack: Bye. Hoo. That should hold me for a while.</p>
<p>Scene: The gymnasium.</p>
<p>Howard: I’m legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I’d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could’ve arranged a carpool.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, yeah? Won’t matter, you’re going down!</p>
<p>Raj: No, uh-uh, you’re going down!</p>
<p>Howard: If anybody’s going to go down, it’s going to be you.</p>
<p>Leonard: Fellas. It’s been 30 minutes. Nobody’s touched each other.</p>
<p>Scene: A street. </p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.</p>
<p>Amy: As am I. (Holds Sheldon’s hand)</p>
<p>Sheldon: What are you doing?</p>
<p>Amy: An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.</p>
<p>Scene: The gymnasium. </p>
<p>Raj: You realize you can’t win.</p>
<p>Howard: I prefer to think that I can’t lose.</p>
<p>Raj: You’re wrong. It’s only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man’s rat trap.</p>
<p>Howard: You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn’t it catch Rat-Man?</p>
<p>Raj: Just because I didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!</p>
<p>Howard: You narcissistic nincompoop!</p>
<p>Raj: You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you’re missing some very excellent superhero quips.</p>
