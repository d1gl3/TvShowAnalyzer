		<p>Scene: The upstairs landing of Mrs Wolowitz’s house.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Almost there. You’re doing great.</p>
<p>Howard: Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.</p>
<p>Raj: Please hurry.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): I don’t need a treadmill.</p>
<p>Howard: The doctor says you need to get exercise.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): I get plenty of exercise.</p>
<p>Howard: Crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.</p>
<p>Raj: If she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?</p>
<p>Howard: She’ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.</p>
<p>Raj: All right. Now what?</p>
<p>Bernadette: We set it up in Howie’s old room.</p>
<p>Raj: Do you know how to set it up?</p>
<p>Howard: Please, I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle… Ma, look out.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.</p>
<p>Credits sequence.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment.</p>
<p>Raj: So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.</p>
<p>Leonard: Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.</p>
<p>Amy: Should we do something for her?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.</p>
<p>Amy: Sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. She got hurt.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy.</p>
<p>Penny: Hi.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hey, how were things on the set?</p>
<p>Penny: Uh, pretty good, actually.</p>
<p>Raj: So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.</p>
<p>Amy: Good for you.</p>
<p>Penny: Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s ever seen.</p>
<p>Leonard: I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler’s List is tough to beat.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Leonard: It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I know.</p>
<p>Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.</p>
<p>Howard: You mean a forklift?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Howie.</p>
<p>Howard: I’m sorry. I just can’t deal with this right now.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?</p>
<p>Howard: Bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?</p>
<p>Bernadette: I would do it for my mother.</p>
<p>Howard: Yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. I’m what my people would call a putz.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?</p>
<p>Howard: We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.</p>
<p>Bernadette: You’d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That’s so cruel.</p>
<p>Howard: Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): I need to tinkle.</p>
<p>Howard: Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?</p>
<p>Bernadette: You are a putz.</p>
<p>Howard: As advertised.</p>
<p>Scene: A cinema.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Thanks for coming with me.</p>
<p>Raj: Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t you gonna get 3-D glasses?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.</p>
<p>Raj: Is that a real thing?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out.</p>
<p>Raj: Emily, Hey.</p>
<p>Emily: Oh, hey, Raj.</p>
<p>Raj: Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?</p>
<p>Emily: Um, you know what? I better go. My movie’s about to start.</p>
<p>Raj: Are you here alone?</p>
<p>Emily: No, not really.</p>
<p>Raj: What do you mean, not really?</p>
<p>Man: Hey, should we get our seats?</p>
<p>Emily: Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I’ll call you later.</p>
<p>Raj: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That was awkward, right?</p>
<p>Raj: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?</p>
<p>Raj: Yes.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.</p>
<p>Scene: The movie set. </p>
<p>Director: And action.</p>
<p>Wil Wheaton: Please don’t shut me out.</p>
<p>Penny: Go away. Just go away.</p>
<p>Wil: I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.</p>
<p>Penny: What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?</p>
<p>Wil: I was trying to save your life.</p>
<p>Penny: Life? What life? Look at me, I’m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don’t know.</p>
<p>Wil: You can’t give up. I love you.</p>
<p>Penny: I love you, too. But I’m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.</p>
<p>Director: And cut. All right. All right, let’s set up for the next scene.</p>
<p>Penny: Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.</p>
<p>Director: Let’s just move on. No one cares.</p>
<p>Penny: Well, I care. I mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?</p>
<p>Director: Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, ’cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn’t be in it.</p>
<p>Leonard: Whoa, whoa, hang on. There’s no need to insult her.</p>
<p>Director: And who are you?</p>
<p>Leonard: I’m her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Director: Isn’t she too hot for you?</p>
<p>Leonard: A little, yeah.</p>
<p>Director: Well, boyfriend, get off my set.</p>
<p>Penny: You can’t do that. He’s with me.</p>
<p>Director: You know what? You can get off my set, too. You’re fired.</p>
<p>Penny: What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.</p>
<p>Director: Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.</p>
<p>Wil: Hey, if you’re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.</p>
<p>Scene: A bar.</p>
<p>Wil: Wow, that fell apart really fast.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment.</p>
<p>Raj: Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.</p>
<p>Raj: You don’t have to make me anything.</p>
<p>Sheldon: No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?</p>
<p>Raj: Sorry, I left them in my turban.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?</p>
<p>Raj: Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.</p>
<p>Raj: But you don’t have s*x with her, either.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Slick, huh?</p>
<p>Raj: To be truthful, Emily and I haven’t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Have you had intercourse?</p>
<p>Raj: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m hungry again.</p>
<p>Howard: It’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock.</p>
<p>Bernadette: You know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it’s gonna be like.</p>
<p>Howard: No, it’s not.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We’re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.</p>
<p>Howard: Maybe you’re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t expect me to do all the work.</p>
<p>Howard: Hey, I’m a very paternal person. I’d be excellent at taking care of a baby.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m still hungry.</p>
<p>Howard: I’m coming, you big baby.</p>
<p>Scene: The bar.</p>
<p>Penny: You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.</p>
<p>Wil: Forget it, man, it’s crap. You just move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You used to be famous.</p>
<p>Wil: Hey. I just lost a job for you.</p>
<p>Penny: All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous.</p>
<p>Wil: Penny, it’s not about being famous. It’s about the art. It’s about the passion we have for our craft. (Text message tone) I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.</p>
<p>Penny: God, what am I doing with my life?</p>
<p>Leonard: You having second thoughts about acting?</p>
<p>Penny: You were on set, you saw what it was like.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, but it’s not always that bad.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, really?</p>
<p>Leonard: What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?</p>
<p>Penny: It was over a bowling alley.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, but there was ample parking.</p>
<p>Penny: Are you done?</p>
<p>Leonard: And you were so good in the TV commercial.</p>
<p>Penny: It was for haemorrhoid cream.</p>
<p>Leonard: And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.</p>
<p>Penny: Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.</p>
<p>Leonard: Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?</p>
<p>Penny: Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny.</p>

<p>Scene: The apartment.</p>
<p>Raj: I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy, I have a great job, I’m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don’t women want to be with me?</p>
<p>Sheldon: An interesting question. Well, good night.</p>
<p>Raj: What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.</p>
<p>Raj: What do you mean?</p>
<p>Sheldon: How many women have you had dates with?</p>
<p>Raj: Eleven.</p>
<p>Sheldon: How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?</p>
<p>Raj: Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Sure.</p>
<p>Raj: I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, now do you see the problem?</p>
<p>Raj: Maybe. I, I don’t know.It’s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.</p>
<p>Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Howie, I’m back!</p>
<p>Howard: Shh, I just got her to sleep.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Sorry.</p>
<p>Howard: What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.</p>
<p>Bernadette: They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.</p>
<p>Howard: Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?</p>
<p>Bernadette: So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.</p>
<p>Howard: A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Queen? I’ve been killing myself here.</p>
<p>Howard: Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I’m nice, I want to take care of people.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard.</p>
<p>Howard: Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.</p>
<p>Scene: Raj’s apartment.</p>
<p>Raj: Hey.</p>
<p>Emily: Thanks for letting me come over.</p>
<p>Raj: Of course. Please, come in.</p>
<p>Emily: I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we’re okay.</p>
<p>Raj: Uh, look, you and I haven’t made any commitments to each other.</p>
<p>Emily: I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he’s been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.</p>
<p>Raj: It’s okay.</p>
<p>Emily: Really?</p>
<p>Raj: Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s my issue, not yours.</p>
<p>Emily: Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I’d be pretty upset.</p>
<p>Raj: Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.</p>
<p>Emily: Just so you know, I’m not seeing anyone else.</p>
<p>Raj: Well, me, neither.</p>
<p>Emily: Okay.</p>
<p>Raj: Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?</p>
<p>Emily: Yeah.</p>
<p>Raj: I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.</p>
<p>Emily: That’s cool.</p>
<p>Raj: It’s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?</p>
<p>Emily: One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.</p>
<p>Raj: It’s, uh, been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really not her shoulder.</p>
<p>Emily: Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?</p>
<p>Raj: But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.</p>
<p>Scene: Penny’s apartment.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, my God. What a day.</p>
<p>Leonard: Can I get you anything?</p>
<p>Penny: No. I need to start making some smart decisions.</p>
<p>Leonard: With your career?</p>
<p>Penny: With my life.</p>
<p>Leonard: Like what?</p>
<p>Penny: I don’t know. We could get married.</p>
<p>Leonard: Come on, be serious.</p>
<p>Penny: I am.</p>
<p>Leonard: Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?</p>
<p>Penny: Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Leonard: So I’m like a bran muffin.</p>
<p>Penny: What? No, that’s not what I’m saying.</p>
<p>Leonard: No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.</p>
<p>Penny: What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you.</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.</p>
<p>Penny: Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.</p>
<p>Leonard: No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.</p>
<p>Penny: You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it up.</p>
<p>Leonard: You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.</p>
<p>Leonard: Then what do you need?</p>
<p>Penny: You, you stupid Pop-Tart.</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh. Then I guess I’m in.</p>
<p>Penny: Really? You guess you’re in?</p>
<p>Leonard: Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!</p>
<p>Penny: Okay. Leonard: Cool.</p>
<p>Leonard: So is that it? Are, are we engaged?</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>Leonard: All right.</p>
<p>Penny: What’s wrong?</p>
<p>Leonard: I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, it kind of does, huh?</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, I know. This might help.</p>
<p>Penny: Where did you get a ring?</p>
<p>Leonard: I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, my God, yes.</p>
<p>Leonard: This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.</p>
<p>Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.</p>
<p>Howard: How you feeling?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Last night was a little rough, but I think we’re gonna get through this.</p>
<p>Howard: I’m proud of us.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Me, too.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz (off): Where’s my pancakes?!</p>
<p>Foreign Nurse: Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!</p>
<p>Bernadette: You were right.</p>
<p>Howard: Welcome to Team Putz.</p>
