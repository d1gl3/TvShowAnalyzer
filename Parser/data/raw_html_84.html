		<p>Scene: A public washroom. Amy and Penny are in cubicles, Bernadette is washing her hands.</p>
<p>Amy: I must say, Penny, this is great fun.</p>
<p>Penny: Glad you’re enjoying yourself.</p>
<p>Amy: Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Amy, you must’ve been in the bathroom with other women before.</p>
<p>Amy: Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.</p>
<p>Amy: You okay in there, bestie?</p>
<p>Penny: I’m fine.</p>
<p>Amy: The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, I said I’m fine. Stop talking to me.</p>
<p>Amy: She always this crabby when she urinates?</p>
<p>Bernadette: We’re really not that close.</p>
<p>Penny: Screw it. I’ll go later.</p>
<p>Amy: And I’ll be right by your side.</p>
<p>Scene: A shoe shop. </p>
<p>Bernadette: Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, that’s nice.</p>
<p>Amy: No, it’s not. It’s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard’s new girlfriend is testing Bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.</p>
<p>Bernadette: You think?</p>
<p>Amy: Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Well, what makes me the weakest member?</p>
<p>Amy: Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn’t last a minute on the Serengeti.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, Amy, you’re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don’t have a problem with Leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.</p>
<p>Bernadette: It doesn’t matter. I’m going to tell her we can’t make it.</p>
<p>Amy: Oh, no. You have to go.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I don’t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.</p>
<p>Amy: You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we’re going to use that to our advantage.</p>
<p>Penny: Wait. What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Amy: By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya’s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard’s no stranger to back-alley cockfights.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I don’t know. I’m not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.</p>
<p>Amy: Don’t worry. I’ll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, I don’t know you people. I’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.</p>
<p>Amy: How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?</p>
<p>Bernadette: I don’t want anything in my ample bosom.</p>
<p>Amy: Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.</p>
<p>Credits sequence </p>
<p>Leonard: Okay, see you later.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.</p>
<p>Leonard: That is good news. Bye.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.</p>
<p>Leonard: That, that’s brilliant.</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s what I do. But wait, there’s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.</p>
<p>Leonard: Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?</p>
<p>Sheldon: When the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.</p>
<p>Leonard: All right.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.</p>
<p>Leonard: Elegant.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That’s because it’s simple.</p>
<p>Leonard: Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.</p>
<p>Sheldon: And…</p>
<p>Leonard: And what?</p>
<p>Sheldon: And a third person. It’s three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.</p>
<p>Leonard: Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy s*x life.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time machines.</p>
<p>Leonard: Got it. Bye.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You know I’m right.</p>
<p>Leonard (outside apartment): I think he’s getting worse.</p>
<p>Amy: Oh, my metatarsal are barking.</p>
<p>Leonard: You okay?</p>
<p>Amy: Yeah, yeah. I’m just breaking in some new shoes.</p>
<p>Leonard: Very pretty.</p>
<p>Amy: Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?</p>
<p>Leonard: Hadn’t really thought about it.</p>
<p>Amy: Look.</p>
<p>Leonard: Uh, sure. Very… prominent.</p>
<p>Amy: Please, Leonard, don’t leer, you have a girlfriend.</p>
<p>Leonard: Sorry.</p>
<p>Amy: So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah. How did you know?</p>
<p>Amy: I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, ’cause, you know, that’s kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.</p>
<p>Scene: Raj’s apartment.</p>
<p>Priya: Hey, you.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?</p>
<p>Raj: The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.</p>
<p>Priya: Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?</p>
<p>Raj: I have to feel sorry for myself. I’m the only one who cares. Just like I’m the only one who’ll have s*x with me.</p>
<p>Leonard: Really? In front of your sister?</p>
<p>Priya: We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.</p>
<p>Raj: Excuse me. I’m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart. (Leaves, then returns a moment later) I forgot my windbreaker. It’s chilly.</p>
<p>Scene: Penny’s apartment. </p>
<p>Amy: I don’t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?</p>
<p>Penny: No. Once these puppies touch the ground they’re mine, and I’ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.</p>
<p>Amy: Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.</p>
<p>Penny: The what?</p>
<p>Amy: Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation “Priya Wouldn’t Wanna Be-ya.”</p>
<p>Penny: Hey. Seriously? Didn’t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?</p>
<p>Amy: I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn’t have any.</p>
<p>Penny: None?</p>
<p>Amy: I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It’s the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.</p>
<p>Penny: Wh… What the hell did she say?</p>
<p>Amy: She thinks it’s cool you’re following your dream, no matter what.</p>
<p>Penny: That bitch!</p>
<p>Amy: How do you want to handle it?</p>
<p>Penny: Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I’m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.</p>
<p>Amy: Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?</p>
<p>Penny: What? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Amy: I’m gonna say 3-D. That’ll let her know the studio has faith in it.</p>
<p>Scene: Raj’s apartment.</p>
<p>Leonard: You’re kidding. 3-D?</p>
<p>Bernadette: That’s what I hear.</p>
<p>Howard: Then the studio must have real faith in it.</p>
<p>Leonard: Wonder why she didn’t tell me.</p>
<p>Priya: Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?</p>
<p>Leonard: No.</p>
<p>Priya: Then why are you surprised she didn’t tell you?</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.</p>
<p>Priya: What other thing?</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don’t, oh, what’s the word I’m looking for?</p>
<p>Howard: I’m not going to help you. This is hilarious.</p>
<p>Bernadette: She’s also dating an astronaut.</p>
<p>Priya: Wow. That’s very impressive.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Yeah. But Leonard’s impressive, too.</p>
<p>Leonard: Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is playing three person chess by himself. </p>
<p>Sheldon: Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you. (Knock on door) Will the two of you excuse me?</p>
<p>Raj: I need a hug.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Sorry, I have company.</p>
<p>Raj: Come on, Sheldon, open the door.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I don’t want to hug you.</p>
<p>Raj: I don’t want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Blue, as in depressed.</p>
<p>Raj: Well, not so much depressed as lonely.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I don’t know what colour lonely is.</p>
<p>Raj: What?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.</p>
<p>Raj: Nothing rhymes with orange. It’s probably lonely.</p>
<p>Sheldon: All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don’t see that catching on at all.</p>
<p>Raj: What are you doing?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m working on my three-person chess game.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, cool. Can I play?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?</p>
<p>Raj: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.</p>
<p>Raj: No, thank you. I’m fine.</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s not optional. We’re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.</p>
<p>Raj: I, uh, I guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?</p>
<p>Raj: I’m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I’m such a basket case, I can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.</p>
<p>Sheldon: The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself.</p>
<p>Raj: Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I’m scared.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yellow. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Raj: A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. He says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Fascinating. What’s in it?</p>
<p>Raj: I’m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I like cows.</p>
<p>Raj: That’s not the point.</p>
<p>Sheldon: It was its own point. Go on.</p>
<p>Raj: I’m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I’m afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Rajesh, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.</p>

<p>Scene: Raj’s apartment. </p>
<p>Howard: Okay, I’m still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?</p>
<p>Bernadette: I don’t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.</p>
<p>Howard: Most of those guys live in Texas.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Obviously, this one doesn’t.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Leonard lives here. Priya’s from India. People meet, Howard. God!</p>
<p>Howard: Fine.</p>
<p>Bernadette: You’ve met lots of astronauts, and I’ve never grilled you about that. I’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy.</p>
<p>Howard: I’m not grilling you, I was just curious.</p>
<p>Leonard: I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause I don’t.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Maybe that’s where she met the astronaut, all right?</p>
<p>Priya: I’m sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?</p>
<p>Bernadette: He’s a consultant.</p>
<p>Leonard: I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?</p>
<p>Bernadette: He can’t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?</p>
<p>Howard: It’s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Scene: Penny’s apartment. </p>
<p>Penny (to the shoes): All right, guys, you have to go back. I can’t afford you. “No, don’t send</p>
<p>us away, we love you.” I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent. “But, Penny, you look so good in us.” Damn it, the shoes are right.</p>
<p>Amy: Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless. (Phone rings) What do you got for me, wildebeest?</p>
<p>Bernadette (in Raj’s bathroom): I think they’re on to me. The story’s starting to fall apart.</p>
<p>Amy: Calm down. Everything’s going to be okay. (To Penny) We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I’m putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?</p>
<p>Bernadette: In the bathroom.</p>
<p>Amy: Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What’s the problem?</p>
<p>Bernadette: They’re just asking me all sorts of questions I can’t answer.</p>
<p>Amy: Just change the subject.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya’s parents.</p>
<p>Penny: What?</p>
<p>Bernadette: They said something about going there this summer.</p>
<p>Penny: What, are they getting engaged?</p>
<p>Bernadette: I don’t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy’s stupid astronaut story!</p>
<p>Amy: What astronaut story?</p>
<p>Bernadette: You texted me Penny’s dating an astronaut.</p>
<p>Amy: I texted architect. That’s amusing. Auto-correct must’ve changed it.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Yeah, it’s hysterical.</p>
<p>Penny: All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.</p>
<p>Amy: Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?</p>
<p>Penny: Look, just find out what’s up with this trip to India.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I don’t want to do this anymore!</p>
<p>Penny: Don’t you quit on us!</p>
<p>Howard (knocking on bathroom door): Bernie, you okay?</p>
<p>Bernadette (screaming): It was an architect!</p>
<p>Scene: A coffee shop.</p>
<p>Raj: Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You’re a good friend.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m glad you think so. That’s what I strive to emulate.</p>
<p>Raj: Okay, let’s see if this drug works.</p>
<p>Woman at table: Can I help you?</p>
<p>Raj: Forgive me for staring, but you’re very beautiful.</p>
<p>Woman: Thank you. That’s a great accent. Where are you from?</p>
<p>Raj: India.</p>
<p>Woman: Oh, cool. I’ve always wanted to go there.</p>
<p>Raj: It’s a beautiful country. You’d love it. May I join you?</p>
<p>Woman: Uh, okay, sure. Why not?</p>
<p>Raj: My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.</p>
<p>Woman: Hi.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, there’s no need to interact with me. I’m just here to observe.</p>
<p>Woman: What’s he observing?</p>
<p>Raj: We’re scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.</p>
<p>Sheldon: All right.</p>
<p>Raj: And what is your name?</p>
<p>Woman: Angela.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.</p>
<p>Angela: You’re cute.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’d like to buy a scone.</p>
<p>Server: Oh, I’m sorry, we’re out. We have muffins.</p>
<p>Sheldon: They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.</p>
<p>Angela: What are you doing?</p>
<p>Raj (taking his shirt off): Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>Angela: I…</p>
<p>Sheldon: They were out of scones.</p>
<p>Raj (removing his trousers): Sheldon, I’m talking to someone. You’re being rude. I’ll bet you’re an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.</p>
<p>Angela: Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Raj: Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my pen1s. Ta-da!</p>
<p>Scene: Raj’s apartment. They are playing Jenga, </p>
<p>Priya: Who wants some more coffee?</p>
<p>Leonard: Thanks, yeah.</p>
<p>Howard: Sure.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Let me help you.</p>
<p>Howard: Nice to see that the gals are getting along.</p>
<p>Leonard: Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?</p>
<p>Bernadette: This trip to India sounds fun.</p>
<p>Priya: Yeah, I think it will be.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?</p>
<p>Priya: A little. They’re very old-fashioned.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Well, I wouldn’t worry about it. It’s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?</p>
<p>Priya: Oh, God, no. We’re not there yet.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.</p>
<p>Priya: You’ve been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Yes. Are you writing a book?</p>
<p>Priya: Why are you getting upset?</p>
<p>Bernadette: I’m not upset. Maybe you’re upset.</p>
<p>Priya: What’s up with you? Bernadette?</p>
<p>Bernadette: I can’t do this anymore! I’m a good girl! I went to Catholic school! (Storms out,)</p>
<p>Howard: Okay, well, it’s getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?</p>
<p>Leonard: I think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment. Sheldon, Leonard and Howard are playing three person chess. </p>
<p>Sheldon: My catapult flings my bishop to Howard’s Queen’s Gorilla two.</p>
<p>Howard: Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard’s Queen’s Bishop</p>
<p>five-and-a-third. Check on Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?</p>
<p>Sheldon: When it’s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.</p>
<p>Raj (still naked): Hey, I’ve got winners.</p>
