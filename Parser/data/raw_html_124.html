		<p>Scene: The Apartment.</p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon, your food’s getting cold.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’ll eat later. Right now, I’m suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.</p>
<p>Penny: It’s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.</p>
<p>Raj: So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?</p>
<p>Howard: Let me see.</p>
<p>Raj: Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.</p>
<p>Howard: Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we’ve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don’t you think?</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, if that’s your idea of what’s cool, you should get one.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, so, I’m out.</p>
<p>Raj: What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?</p>
<p>Raj: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Don’t waste my time.</p>
<p>Leonard: You get that these are personalised action figures.</p>
<p>Penny: Honey, if you want one, just get one.</p>
<p>Howard: You’re still out, right?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yep.</p>
<p>Credits sequence.</p>
<p>Scene: Sheldon’s office.</p>
<p>Sheldon: A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He’s dividing both sides by I. He’s adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He’s plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!</p>
<p>Kripke: Cooper?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Nobel. Kripke. Don’t look at my board.</p>
<p>Kripke: What’s that?</p>
<p>Sheldon: That’s a drawing of a really cool train. Don’t look at that, either. What do you want?</p>
<p>Kripke: I have some bad news. You’re working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I’m working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.</p>
<p>Sheldon: So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That’s hard cheese, Barry. You’re one of the good ones.</p>
<p>Kripke: No, they’re making us work together.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That’s ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn’t even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!</p>
<p>Scene: Howard’s lab.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.</p>
<p>Howard: Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.</p>
<p>Raj: They’re here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I’ve ever spent.</p>
<p>Leonard: A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?</p>
<p>Howard: Easy. His family’s loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.</p>
<p>Raj: Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I’m not dark chocolate. I’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, man. Look at my nose.</p>
<p>Leonard: Maybe it’s a shipping problem.</p>
<p>Howard: What?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.</p>
<p>Raj: This sucks.</p>
<p>Howard: I can’t believe I wasted all that money.</p>
<p>Leonard: Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn’t let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.</p>
<p>Scene: The stairwell.</p>
<p>Penny: I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, sometimes there’s a secret ending, like in The Avengers.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, but I don’t think that’s going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Leonard: They could show bloopers. Oh, no.</p>
<p>Penny: What is that?</p>
<p>Leonard: That is Sheldon’s “I’m unhappy and about to destroy the planet” music. Come on, let’s just go to your place.</p>
<p>Penny: Well, wait, if he’s unhappy,shouldn’t we talk to him?</p>
<p>Leonard: Shouldn’t we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?</p>
<p>Penny (entering apartment): You doing okay, sweetie?</p>
<p>Sheldon: There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don’t know where you’re from, but where I’m from, that means I’m not doing okay.</p>
<p>Leonard: Want me to make you some tea?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Tea is for when I’m upset. I’m not upset. The university’s forcing me to work with Kripke. I’m outraged.</p>
<p>Leonard: So, cocoa?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be paired with someone who’s so incredibly annoying?</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, teacher! Me! Me!</p>
<p>Sheldon: See, I did all this great work, and now he’s just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.</p>
<p>Penny: What beverage do you make for that?</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!</p>
<p>Scene: Sheldon’s office.</p>
<p>Kripke: What the fwig, Cooper? We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.</p>
<p>Sheldon: And yet, now you’re in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.</p>
<p>Kripke: We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Why don’t you show me yours first.</p>
<p>Kripke: You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.</p>
<p>Sheldon: How do I know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?</p>
<p>Kripke: How do I know you’re not going to do that with mine?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Because I’m not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.</p>
<p>Kripke: Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other’s work, meet again tomowow?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Fine.</p>
<p>Kripke: Nice twy. This is bwank paper.</p>
<p>Sheldon: And I am sure it’s still more valuable than whatever’s in here.</p>
<p>Kripke: Cough it up, Cooper.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Very well.</p>
<p>Kripke: If this one’s bwank, too, I’m going to be fuwious.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Fine.</p>
<p>Scene: Howard’s lab.</p>
<p>Raj: You! Always bet on black.</p>
<p>Howard: Get that waste of money out of my face.</p>
<p>Raj: It’s only a waste of money if we don’t play with them. (As doll) He’s right, dawg.</p>
<p>Howard: Please, I’m working.</p>
<p>Raj: You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, yeah? How’s that?</p>
<p>Raj: Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it’s three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.</p>
<p>Howard: I have always wanted a 3-D printer.</p>
<p>Raj: Of course you have. They’re an engineer’s dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.</p>
<p>Howard: Yeah, but they’re so expensive.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, come on. You deserve one. You’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.</p>
<p>Howard: Well, the prices have been coming down.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, true. They’re practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.</p>
<p>Howard: And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools…</p>
<p>Raj: Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin’ dream house.</p>
<p>Howard: We don’t need Malibu Koothrappali’s dream house.</p>
<p>Raj: Really, smart guy? Where’s he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment.</p>
<p>Amy:The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe. I’m supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it’s hard because now he reminds me of my uncle. You’ve been awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’m fine.</p>
<p>Amy: All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yes.</p>
<p>Amy: Sheldon, what’s going on?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I read his research, and, it’s leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It’s his mommy.</p>
<p>Amy: Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?</p>
<p>Sheldon: What do we have to lose?</p>
<p>Amy: How’s that?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I feel like I’m being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why’d you stop?</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment.</p>
<p>Leonard: Come on, Sheldon, we’re going to be late.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I can’t go in today. I’m sick.</p>
<p>Leonard: You’re not sick. You just don’t want to face Kripke.</p>
<p>Sheldon: No, look.</p>
<p>Leonard: 128.</p>
<p>Sheldon: See?</p>
<p>Leonard: What did you do, put this in your tea?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, dear. Now I’m not even smarter than you.</p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon, Kripke’s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, don’t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.</p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.</p>
<p>Sheldon: All right, geez. What a grouch.</p>
<p>Leonard: How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.</p>

<p>Scene: Howard’s lab.</p>
<p>Howard: Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?</p>
<p>Raj: I think this thing was made in China.</p>
<p>Howard: Eh, what can you do?</p>
<p>Raj: Ooh, I, I think it’s done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.</p>
<p>Howard: Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.</p>
<p>Raj: And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, I wish I was in better shape.</p>
<p>Howard: Stop holding your stomach in. I’ll give you a six-pack with the computer.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.</p>
<p>Howard: All right, you can suck it in a little bit.</p>
<p>Scene: Sheldon’s office.</p>
<p>Kripke: Cooper, we have a pwobwem. Your work is weawy not at a wevew I expected it to be.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.</p>
<p>Kripke: Don’t pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.</p>
<p>Sheldon: We do?</p>
<p>Kripke: You have a girlfwiend.</p>
<p>Sheldon: So?</p>
<p>Kripke: So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I’m getting.</p>
<p>Kripke: You wucky b*st*rd.</p>
<p>Sheldon: What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.</p>
<p>Kripke: Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we’re gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I’ll do what I can. But it’s not going to be easy, because when I’m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic</p>
<p>Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, good, you’re home. Got a little surprise for you.</p>
<p>Bernadette: What?</p>
<p>Howard: Say hello to my little friend.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Oh, my God. That’s so cute. I didn’t think there could be a smaller version of you.</p>
<p>Howard: I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Oh, Howie, I love these.</p>
<p>Howard: I thought you might.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Were they expensive?</p>
<p>Howard: Didn’t cost a thing. I made them myself.</p>
<p>Bernadette: How?</p>
<p>Howard: Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.</p>
<p>Bernadette: $5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?</p>
<p>Howard: Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.</p>
<p>Bernadette: At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?</p>
<p>Howard: It’s kind of dawning on me now.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I don’t believe you. Howie, we can’t afford to waste money on junk like this.</p>
<p>Howard: What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.</p>
<p>Howard: Yes, but we’re married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don’t like it, but that’s how love works.</p>
<p>Bernadette: No, here’s how love works. You’re gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?</p>
<p>Scene: The apartment.</p>
<p>Penny: All right, I don’t understand. Why didn’t you just tell Kripke the truth?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.</p>
<p>Leonard: Is my coitus whimsically inventive?</p>
<p>Penny: That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.</p>
<p>Leonard: I know you’re joking, but I’d be okay with that.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Of course.</p>
<p>Penny: You ever going to sleep with Amy?</p>
<p>Sheldon: That’s awfully personal.</p>
<p>Leonard: We don’t ask Sheldon things like that.</p>
<p>Penny: Maybe you don’t, I do. What’s the deal?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, word around the university is I’m giving her s*x organs a proper jostling.</p>
<p>Penny: All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?</p>
<p>Leonard: All right, we’re down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, first of all, I’m quite fond of Amy.</p>
<p>Penny: Then what’s the problem?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I’m working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy’s chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.</p>
<p>Leonard: Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It’s a possibility.</p>
<p>Penny (under breath while hitting Leonard): Oh, my God! (Out loud) Sheldon, I know this wasn’t easy for you, and I’m really glad we could have this conversation.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Fine.</p>
<p>Penny (under breath while hitting Leonard): Oh, my God!</p>
<p>Leonard: Ow!</p>
<p>Scene: The cafeteria.</p>
<p>Raj: Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?</p>
<p>Howard: Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.</p>
<p>Raj: Wow, that’s harsh.</p>
<p>Howard: Tell me about it.</p>
<p>Raj: Aren’t you gonna eat lunch?</p>
<p>Howard: Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.</p>
<p>Scene: Sheldon’s office.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, the equation balances, but it’s certainly not elegant.</p>
<p>Kripke: Whatever. You get any wast night?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yes.</p>
<p>Kripke: Gave it to her good, huh?</p>
<p>Sheldon: No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put…</p>
<p>Kripke: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I didn’t notice.</p>
<p>Kripke: How could you not notice?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.</p>
<p>Kripke: Ah, you’re kiwing me, Cooper!</p>
<p>Sheldon: Can we get back to work?</p>
<p>Kripke: Sure, sure, sure. You guys ever use any toys?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.</p>
<p>Kripke: A wocket? You’we a fweak! I wove it!</p>
